# Demonstration of the loop subdivision algorithm on (triangular) meshes.

## Credit
The repo is created by Zhuoting Xie as his solution to the homework assignment of CPSC424 delivered by Prof. Alla Sheffer in the 2022W1 term in the University of British Columbia (Vancouver). Only code inside `./js/subdivision.js` are novely implemented by Zhuoting. All other files are prepared by the course teaching assistants.

## Use
A few mesh examples are prepared and stored in `./meshes` (by the course staff). To run the web demonstrator, simply drag `./a7.html` to your web browser. The algorithm supports adding or removing vertices as you increase or decrease subdivision levels. Please refer to solution videos in `./demo` for example usage.
